## The Game: Sokoban with a Twist
You’re looking at a colorful landscape with various odd statues strewn about. The statues are upset because they’ve been knocked off their pedestals. They want to return to their perches, but they can’t move without your help. Use the arrow keys to move all the statues in a given direction, help restore the statues to their pedestals, and find out who’s going around knocking them down.


## Hypothesis 1: "Sales Hypothesis"
  > 20,000 Steam gamers will pay $10 for an original, challenging Sokoban-style puzzle game.

### Supporting Evidence
#### Crowdfunding and Greenlight
Sokoban games don’t have a strong presence on crowdsourcing sites. On Kickstarter I was only able to find a single project – [Push][1], which met its goal . . . of $125. On Greenlight I found four Sokoban titles, two of which have been approved for publishing. Judging from the number of comments, these games failed to excite Steam gamers. For comparison’s sake, games in the biking genre have many times more comments. Overall I would say the available evidence is mixed. It’s a neutral sign that half the Greenlight games have passed. It’s a small red flag that the entries generated so little buzz.

#### Steam and Steam Spy
Moving on to Steam proper, there aren’t many published Sokoban games, either. In the past two years, just seven original titles were released. Is there an underserved market for these games, or do customers prefer other games? One sign that gamers enjoy the genre is the performance of older games and re-releases. Games like [Sokobond][2], [Chuck’s Challenge 3D][3], and [Chip’s Challenge][4] all have hundreds of reviews and estimated owners in the tens of thousands.

Looking more closely at recent titles, two have one hundred reviews with the rest having fewer than twenty. If every game had very few reviews that would be a serious red flag, indicating that the market for Sokoban games doesn’t exist. The presence of these popular titles gives hope that it’s possible to reach a broader market.

With that being said, neither game supports our hypothesis. Estimating number of owners via number of reviews, [Parcel][5] and [A Good Snowman][6] have roughly 10,000 owners. To make matters worse, Parcel is just $4.99 suggesting that a lower price point won’t help us meet our revenue goals by increasing sales volume. Looking up both titles on SteamSpy reveals more bad news. Parcel and A Good Snowman are estimated to have 18,000 and 4,000 owners, respectively. A far cry from our target of 20,000!

## Conclusion
We’ve looked at two sources of data and found mixed results. On the one hand, there’s clearly interest in Sokoban games on Steam as evidenced by yesteryear’s hits and today’s top titles. On the other hand, interest may be waning and the data doesn’t strongly support our hypothesis. As with the [word game][7] we evaluated last time, the market is wide open with mostly weak competitors, but is the prize worth the risk? We’ve seen that:

  1. Crowdsourcing sites are tepid on Sokoban games. This suggests gamers aren't excited about the genre and that it will be difficult to convince them to give a new game a chance.
  1. The most recent, successful games in the genre fall short of support our hypothesis. The addressable market for Sokoban games may be too small to realistically meet our goal.

It seems like this game is a high risk, medium reward proposition. What would improve the outlook?

  > Hypothesis 1.1: A well-executed Sokoban-style game released in 2017 will sell many more copies than Parcel and A Good Snowman.

But is the above plausible? In my opinion, no. Both games are quite well made and well liked by their players, so where would the extra players come from? Our game would need to draw players who skipped these titles while still keeping Sokoban fans interested. Possible? Yes. But I don’t believe our idea, as pitched, is sufficiently differentiated to meet this goal. 


### Closing Thoughts
As with the word game, this idea is tempting but ultimately not a great choice. Making games is as risky business and it’s our job as creators to reduce the risk where possible. So why gamble when the prize is paltry? With that being said, the data more strongly supports this idea than our word game. 

While I wasn’t able to persuasively argue that our game would achieve sales greatly in excess of the current titles, what if we could revise our original hypothesis down? If we tweak our original hypothesis to, say, 10,000 copies sold the case becomes much stronger. Now we just need to achieve parity with Parcel and A Good Snowman.

Would it be worth building our game with a more modest goal in mind? That all depends on the scope of the final product and how expensive it would be to build it. A good discussion for a future post. For now I hope you’ve enjoyed my analysis and please share your feedback in the comments.
