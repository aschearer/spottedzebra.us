Scramble Legends
all started with an idea for a new user interface.
After releasing Adlib I started to work on
multiplier functionality for the title. At the same
time, I felt that Adlib's style was holding the
game back. Its artwork was not well suited for
larger screens and its theme was a bit too generic.
Given I needed to create new interfaces for
multiplayer I felt the time was ripe to make a
break. So one weekend I powered up Photoshop and
started to explore different options.

From the get go I had three goals in mind when
updating the user interface:

  * Focus on the content
  * Emphasis on typography
  * Alive with activity

In the back of my mind I had games such as
Spelltower and Letterpress which both emphasize the
letters over the game area. I really liked their
aesthetic and wanted to see how it might apply to
Adlib. 

Initially I tried to keep Adlib's layout with a
second board added for the opponent. I liked
Adlib's placement of its logo and usage of white
space and tried to preserve that in Scramble
Legends. In order to place more emphasis on the
game itself, I also removed the faux textures,
gradients, and other distracting elements.

Encouraged by my progress I kept working eventually
striking on the idea of avatars. I wanted Scramble
Legends to have a personal feel and also a strong
brand and early on I felt that avatars offered
these things. In addition, the avatars provided a
great way to add more activity and feedback to the
game. They can bounce, wiggle, and change state in
response to various game events.

You can also see the addition of a subtle guide to
the board. The board fills up as the game
progresses and you lose when the board is
full. As a result I wanted to make it easier for
you to gauge how you are doing. The guide was
added to this end as it helps you quickly
estimate how many rows are empty. It also helps
break up the space on the board making it a bit
less plain looking.

Eventually, I hired Kyle McGill to help create the
avatars. As we worked together it became clear that
the avatars were going to be bigger on the screen
than originally planned. After all, if avatars are
really an important part of the game and
reflect on you they should be big and
visible not tucked away out of sight. As are a
result I had to rebalance the user interface. Gone
were the title and ample white space at the top of
the screen. In their stead are the avatars,
commanding the board from on high.

Along the way I also gave the board eyes. Once
again I wanted to create a more personal, alive
aesthetic. The board eyes offer yet another
way to customize the experience as well as some
juicy activity for various events in the game.

In the end the game's user interface evolved a bit
more to look like this:

Mainly, the changes were dictated by changes to the
gameplay itself. As features were added or removed
the interface changed as necessary. All in all I'm
quite pleased with the result. The avatars, board,
and eyes are all alive with activity, and there are
very few non-essential elements on the screens
letting you focus on the act of spelling.
