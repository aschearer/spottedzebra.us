Having recently founded Spotted Zebra, an independent game studio, one of my first 
strategic decisions was to select a platform. Like most developers, I have read many
success stories about iOS. Likewise, when discussing platforms with other 
entrepreneurs, the strength of Apple's platform is oft reinforced. Despite this, 
I opted to start by releasing my games for Windows 8. What follows will examine the
thought process behind my decision and explain why you should reconsider the 
platform you are targeting.

### Sailing the Blue Ocean
#### Developers appear to be hesitating to support the new platform
On the eve of Windows 8's release developers remain aloof. Famously, Minecraft 
author "Notch" has come out against Windows 8 because he fears it will harm open 
platforms. Whether or not he is correct, developers seem to share his reluctance, 
and as I write this less than one thousand games are available on the Windows 8 
Store<sup>1</sup>. Developers indeed seem to be a curiously conservative type, but even if 
the number of games should triple ahead of Windows 8's launch it is clear that 
the platform will have relatively few games.

#### It's an ocean, not a sea
Of course, there are many platforms with very few games. What distinguishes 
Windows 8 from, say, Windows Phone? In a word, scale. Regardless of whether you 
use Windows or not, it is likely that Microsoft will sell many copies of its 
latest operating system in the coming year. Not convinced? Take a look at the 
first year sales for Windows Vista and Windows 7<sup>2</sup>:

    <figcaption>
    In their first year, Windows 7 & Vista sold over 100,000,000 copies. 
    How many copies do you think Windows 8 will sell in its first year?

Given that Vista was widely perceived to be a failure, Vista's sales are likely 
a lower bound. After all, Microsoft is spending huge sums on advertising for 
Windows 8 as well as offering it as an upgrade for an unprecedented $40<sup>3</sup>. 
Bottom line, there will likely be over 100,000,000 potential customers on the 
platform a year from now with very few great games to satisfy their tastes or 
open their wallets for.

### Red Storms Ahead
#### Some perspective on your favorite platform
All of that said, it is worth comparing the prospects of Windows 8 against those 
of iOS. As the platform to beat, iOS often gets a free pass when discussing 
strategy. However, entrepreneurs are doing themselves a disservice by avoiding the 
facts. For starters, the iOS marketplace is not as big as you think. Let us look 
at the number of iPhones and iPads sold in 2011<sup>4</sup>:

    <figcaption>
    In 2011 Windows sold twice as many copies as iOS. Sales may be converging, but 
    do you expect them to meet in 2012?

As should be clear, in the past calendar year the iPhone actually sold fewer units 
than Windows Vista sold in its first year. Though the iOS market is a hot one, it 
is still relatively small. None can deny that the iPhone has a head start on 
Windows 8. According to Apple's Q2 earnings call the company sold 365,000,000 iOS 
devices to date. But it is not difficult to imagine that number being overtaken by 
Windows 8 in the next two years if sales of past versions of Windows are any 
indication.

#### Fighting for the crumbs
Looking beyond sheer volume, I wonder whether there is any profit left in the iOS 
market for small game studios such as Spotted Zebra that do not yet have strong 
intellectual property or a big marketing budget. Everyone agrees that Apple's 
marketplace is getting more competitive, but just how competitive? According to 
a survey run by Owen Goss at Streaming Colour most of the revenue is captured by 
a small handful of developers<sup>5</sup>:

    <img src="{{site.url}}/img/posts/2012-10-23-Ignore Windows 8 at Your Peril/revenue-distribution.png"/>
    <figcaption>
    80% of game developers surveyed are fighting over 3% of total revenue on iOS. 
    How are you going to ensure you are not one of them?

Given this breakdown it is clear just how competitive the app marketplace has 
become. With 90% of games earning less than $400,000, how can a small team pay 
itself let alone make a profit? Owen's findings confirm what we already know: 
Apple's App Store is a winner-take-all market and in order to run a successful 
business you have to somehow outperform 90% of your competitors. Hard to do if 
you do not have a game-of-the-year or $30,000<sup>6</sup> set aside for advertising.

### Who Are You Rooting For?
Ultimately, what's important is that my company, Spotted Zebra — or yours — can 
grow its brand, develop strong intellectual property, and earn a profit. In the 
end we are running our businesses for ourselves — not Apple or Microsoft.

Nonetheless, Windows 8 is set to sell a 100,000,000 or more copies. That and the 
relative lack of competition on the platform mean that there is a golden 
opportunity to accomplish our business goals. And it is not simply about making 
a quick buck. Success begets success, and once your game is proven on Windows 8 
it will be easier to assail Apple's App Store. So, why are you still targeting iOS?
