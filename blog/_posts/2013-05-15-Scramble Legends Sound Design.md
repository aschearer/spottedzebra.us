For Scramble Legends, Alex and I wanted to make the sound design
more subtle and natural as opposed to overly bright
and sci-fi;  the idea was to use pleasing, simple
audio to augment the player's actions without
necessarily driving them altogether. We also wanted
emotionally distinctive sounds (positive, negative,
victory, defeat, etc) that weren't over-the-top
with regard to the feedback they intended to
convey.

During the design process, Alex would send me
videos showing all the game mechanics and features
he wanted sounds for and I loaded them into my
<abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>
(Sony Vegas) and put markers on each individual
section that required unique assets. From there, I
searched through my sound libraries for a lot of
organic material such as wooden blocks falling,
paper movements, bubbly sounds, airy whooshes,
stopwatch ticks and so on.

I began editing everything together doing my best
to keep each sound comprised of less than three
layers (they sound less dense that way) and not
relying heavily on <abbr title="Digital Signal Processing">DSP</abbr> 
outside of simple <abbr title="Equalizer">EQ's</abbr> 
and volume automation.

For the tiles flipping, I originally took the sound
of wood sliding across a floor, pitched it up and
made five very short variations out of it but it
didn't work well once Alex implemented it &ndash; it was
too harsh and random. What actually did work was
using one small 'tick' sound that I'd made for the
UI and then slightly altering the pitch of it.

For the 'ready', 'set', 'spell', elements, I made
those from simple chimes and bubble sounds edited
together. And for the overdrive sounds, it was
similar except that I used whoosh sounds instead of
bubbles.

Altogether, it took about one week and three or
four revision passes to get everything implemented
and sounding right.

The simplicity of the audio really worked well for
Scramble Legends. The sounds are just present
enough to give the player some auditory feedback
without encroaching too far into their awareness
which is mostly focused on finding and arranging
words. As all veteran sound designers say, "you
know you're doing your job when nobody notices."
