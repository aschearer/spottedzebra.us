Earlier this month Microsoft Belgium invited me to present the ins and outs of 
porting a XNA game to Windows 8 using MonoGame. Little did I know the invitation 
was just a ploy to record my talk and post it to the internet! Whatever their true 
intentions, I’m delighted to be able to share my presentation with you via 
[Channel 9][1]:

And for those of you who are interested in diving into Windows 8 development 
check out:

  * [Move the Cheese][2]: 
My Ludum Dare 24 project which I converted to run on Windows 8. The code is 
available under the MIT license so feel free to copy and paste into your own 
projects.
  * [XNA Project Templates][3]: 
A collection of Visual Studio project templates I created to speed up creating new games. 
If you use these templates you’ll have a strong foundation to build from as you target 
new platforms using MonoGame.
