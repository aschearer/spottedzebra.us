Early on I
decided that Scramble Legend would feature animated
avatars to represent you in-game. I wanted to give 
you a way to personalize the experience, create a 
basis for branding the game, and add something fun, 
quirky, and animated to the game area. Avatars gave 
me a way to accomplish all three goals.

With that being said, I was not initially sure what
style to adopt for the avatars. To help me decide
and to produce the final art assets I recruited the
help of Kyle McGill. To start off, Kyle and I tried
to determine what the style should be. We
brainstormed a number of ideas ranging from
vegetables to super heroes to giant alligators.

In my opinion, it was incredibly important to spend
time trying a bunch of different styles. At this
stage we were able to test multiple ideas each day.
This gave us a sense of what worked and what didn't
&ndash; both for the game as well as for our skill
sets. Furthermore, because the tests were
relatively cheap to produce we could try many
things &ndash; in the end we tried ten different
passes. This gave us confidence when we moved to
the next step that we were making the right
decision. You may be wondering, why bother to do
all of this exploratory work? In my opinion, it's
very important because when creating artwork for
the game each subsequent step is more expensive
and time consuming. Measure twice cut once!

Honestly, there were a lot of great ideas and I
would love to see some of the things we explored
fleshed out into a more complete style.
Nevertheless, a decision had to be be made! So how
did we narrow things down? Well for starters
intuition and taste. However we also had three
guiding concerns to aid us:

  * The relative cost to produce the art style, including how well it suited Kyle's skillset
  * The expected appeal with Scramble Legend's target audience: women
  * The ability to extend and adapt the art style for new needs, special promotions, etc.

In the end we chose the Tintin style. I felt this
style struck the best balance across the three
dimensions, not to mention just looking good. With
that decision out of the way you might imagine that
our journey in avatar design is finished, but you
would be wrong! In fact, we are just getting
started... but that's a story for next time.
