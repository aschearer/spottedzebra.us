In the beginning 
Alex wanted to see what I could do in terms of my own 
talents.  When it came to creating things in my own 
style I thought about what sort of game Alex wanted to 
make, the audience he expected it to draw in, and of 
what he wanted to do with my artwork. So it basically 
came down to form, substance, and audience.

Scramble Legends, or "Scrambloid" as it was called back then, 
is a fast-paced word game with Scrabble and Tetris-like elements. 
Avatars were to be animated in some fashion so I tried to keep the 
design simpler in order to make animation easier down the road.

Alex and I brainstormed a bunch of avatar ideas using different 
categories to give me a solid basis for generating variety. We 
flung around typical ideas like animals, robots, and super heroes 
as well as some more esoteric ones like plants spirits, mythological 
heroes, and even these little pixie people called Wizzles that 
were "word wizards".

I knew Scramble Legends was geared for a more female audience but 
wanted to find something that could suit almost all age groups. In 
the end we wound up having to add more female characters to cater 
to the female demographic, but still had a general cartoon cast and 
look that would also appeal to children and young adults.

### Borrowing from Others
Before Alex and I made a decision, we thought it best to pull inspiration 
from other styles and cartoonists that might be fun and meet our needs. 
The thing about mimicking others' work is that it shouldn’t be an exact 
copy, especially when you are getting paid for it. Other artists get 
miffed if you are making a profit off of something that took years to 
achieve. It's also a simple matter of respect for the creative property 
of others. That being said, when I made the first styling passes for these 
I did my best to mimic them in order to prove that I could work in the style.

Next, I began to deviate from the style just enough to where it wasn't 
a replica but still retained an influence from the source material. For 
instance, when I was drawing out a Bill Watterson style pass I took note 
of his unique line quality.  If we were to use a Watterson influence, I 
wanted to make sure I nailed that thick and lively line from his ink work.

In the end we liked the Tintin style of Georges Remi (Herge) the best. 
It was easy to break his style down into simple shapes and retool it to 
make custom characters of my own with large amounts of variation.

### Character Casting Call
Once the Tintin style was chosen, I went to work furiously making as many 
different characters as I could. In all I ended up making over 50 different 
characters. To help me get this plethora of personas I broke characters into 
age, gender, and cultural categories as well as sprinkling in other ethnicities 
to give me a sprawling diagram of what could be possible.

One thing I find helps to elaborate on certain characters is to invent a small 
back story.  A character without a past is like a body without a soul, it's the 
mechanism of personality within the design. As a result, my rough drafts would 
start with one thing and then end up somewhere completely different by the time the 
final asset was sent to Alex. This is why some sketches have characters saying 
something in word bubbles to encapsulate their backstory.

### Putting on the Polish
After Alex and I had chosen nine characters we really liked, 
I began to focus on putting these character concepts through 
my finalization pipeline. By this point in the project, Alex 
and I had become more like partners rather than director/artist. 
Given time and money, we decided to cut a few features for launch, 
among them not fully animating the avatars and instead giving 
them four distinct reaction states.  The pipeline went a little 
something like this:

For each of these steps I sent the results to Alex for his thoughts and approval. 
It was important to me that we were both content with what we had. In the 
beginning I started showing the characters in batches but once I began work 
on the reactionary states it became a per character affair.

At this stage generalization was not enough, each character needed tangible 
and visually refined elements and an individual flare. The avatars' 
individuality came from:

  * <em>Their clothing and accessories</em> It's true, clothes do 
make the man or woman. I thought about occupation and lifestyle 
to determine what I'd do in terms of garments.
  * <em>Their hair styles</em> How a person wears their hair can 
drastically change their appearance and reflect a little of 
their personality.
  * <em>Their reactionary states</em> Even though expression is 
last on this list, it's definitely not last in terms of importance. 
How a character reacts to comedy or tragedy or how they carry 
themselves speaks volumes on who they are.

### Globe Trotting Development
The fact that Alex and I live nearly half a globe away (Alex in the 
Netherlands and I in California) gave us the challenge of syncing our 
development time together.  When we were in the concepts phase I would 
wake up and read my Google Talk "wake-up call" from Alex on my phone. 
Typically, Alex would critique and give his thoughts on the previous day's 
submissions. Next I would organize my thoughts on the matter, and then 
we would both decide on what new styles to tackle or expand on that day.

With sketchbook in hand, I biked my way to a local coffee house and got to 
work. Six hours of sketching later and it was back to my house to scan and 
touch up the sketches in Photoshop.  Finally I would add all the day's assets 
to our Dropbox folder along with a summary email ready for Alex's review when 
he woke up. This process worked well throughout the project and became a 
rhythm we found easy to maintain. 

One of the biggest things I believe Alex and I gained from developing Scramble 
Legends is that trust between artist and programmer is paramount.  We had nine 
hours difference between us and worked while the other slept.  It was a situation 
that had the potential to have many things go wrong and fall into dysfunction. But 
our constant dialog and understanding of each other’s role got us, and the game's 
aesthetic, to finish line.
