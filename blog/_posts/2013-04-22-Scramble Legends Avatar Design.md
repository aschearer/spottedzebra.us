So far we've looked at how the [avatars' style was chosen][1]
for Scramble Legends and heard from Kyle McGill about his 
[process to create the final artwork][2]. 
In this post we'll look at how Kyle and I proved that the 
style had enough expressiveness for animation and variability 
for different characters. Once we were satisfied we were finally 
able to buckle down and create the nine avatars needed for 
the game.

For starters we needed to determine whether the
style would support enough characters in the event
that we wanted to add more avatars to the game for
special promotions, seasons, etc. From our previous
prototyping we felt confident this would be the
case, but I like to make sure of these things
before making comparatively more expensive, final
assets. If the style won't ultimately work for many
different avatars then I want to find that out as
soon as possible!

To answer our query Kyle produced two sets of heads
trying to get as much variability as possible. As
you can see there are some really off the wall
characters in there. After seeing these I was
convinced the style would support as many
characters as needed.

The next question was whether the style would look
good animated. I wanted each avatar to have several
different visual states to reflect the state of the
game.  Ideally they would even animate between the
states.  In any case, the art style needed to have
the expressiveness required to show the characters'
emotions. Once again Kyle went to work this time
prototyping different emotions for some of the
possible avatars:

Confident that the art style would support
expressive, varied avatars it was time to figure
out which avatars to use for the game and then to
generate the final art assets. To be honest at this
point I simply chose the avatars that looked fun
and interesting to me!
                            
When the process finally finished Kyle produced
nine excellent avatars each with four distinct
states!
