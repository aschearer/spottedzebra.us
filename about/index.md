Starting with my freshman-year summer spent teaching myself to program with PHP, 
I have logged over ten thousand hours writing code. I’m comfortable wading deep into 
mission critical legacy code or laying the technical foundation for a new complex project.

After graduating from Duke University with degrees in computer science and philosophy, 
I joined Microsoft where I helped design the next generation of Outlook Web Access - 
Outlook's web app. Whenever you schedule a meeting or use group mail you're using  features 
I developed. As a senior engineer at Microsoft I was responsible for the design and 
development of new features for myself as well my feature crew.

Outside of Microsoft I have developed a number of award winning independent games across 
many platforms and using many languages. Most recently I developed and released Tumblestone 
on Mac, PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U. Tumblestone won Intel’s 
“Level Up: Best Puzzle Game” award, was selected for the PAX 10 and PAX East Indie Showcase, 
and launched in July as part of Xbox Game’s with Gold. The game features local and online 
multiplayer, a 30-hour story mode with cutscenes, boss battles, 3 arcade modes, 
and is available in 21 languages.

When I'm not working I help organize events with [Seattle Indies](http://seattleindies.org),
go on hikes in the Pacific Northwest, and try new recipes in the kitchen. If you'd like to
